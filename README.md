Scientific Calculator



A scientific calculator developed using Python is a powerful tool designed to perform a wide 
range of mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic. This project typically includes 
functionalities such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions, which are 
essential for scientific and engineering calculations. Python, with its rich libraries like math
and tkinter for GUI, allows for a versatile and user-friendly calculator interface. By building 
this project, users can gain hands-on experience with Python programming, learn to handle 
complex mathematical computations, and understand how to create an interactive application. 
This calculator can serve as a foundation for further customization and learning in Python 
development.
